  <title>Repository Content</title>

  <body>
    <p>This repository is an upload of an AngularJS project that is set up in
    WebStorm. The project is divided into the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>index.html (and possibly other index files that open different
      samples) -- the file that implements the app's single page, and that is
      bound to the data managed by the Angular directives and
      services</p></li>

      <li><p>app -- a directory containing the Angular modules that implement
      4D</p></li>

      <li><p>assets -- a directory containing content, styling, and external
      JS libs</p></li>
    </ul>
    <note><p>The following list is generated as a conref. It calls the ConrefService with the following
    value for the conref attr: <codeph>jsFunction:buildRefList:Related Links</codeph>. The ConrefService in turn
    calls the ExtensionService to execute a function as follows:
      <codeph>buildRefList("Related Links")</codeph>. The result is this list of related links, derived
      from the TOC entries that lie under this specific topic. This is included here to show an
    example of dynamic content generation.</p></note>
    <p conref = "jsFunction:buildRefList:Related Links"></p>
